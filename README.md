> Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.

### Python 2.X and Python 3.X

Just like every programming language, Python also has different versions. However, Python 3.X is **NOT** completely [backward-compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility). 1 That means you cannot run any code or program that is written by Python 2.X if your computer is running Python 3.0 or above.

1: Python 3.0 \(a.k.a. "Python 3000" or "Py3k"\) is a **new version** of the language that is **incompatible** with the 2.x line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed. Also, the standard library has been reorganized in a few prominent places.
