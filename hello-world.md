# Hello World

After installing Python package, we can have a try on our machine.

#### Start Coding

We can use code editor to start coding our python script. Open Sublime and create a new file, type in following code:

```python
print("Hello Word") 
```

You need to include "\(" and "\)" for Python 3.X or later \(No need for Python 2.X\)

#### Run the code

To run the code we write, we can use Terminal\(Linux/MacOS\) or CMD\(Windows\). Open the Terminal or CMD on your own machine.
