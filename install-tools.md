# Install Tools

Before we start coding Python, we need some tools/libraries:

#### Python 

The most important, Python itself ;\)

Visit [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page download the latest version of Python \(3.8.3\), if you need 2.X version, download 2.7. Usually we will recommend to download the latest version, but some application may require a specific version of Python.



#### Code Editor \(Optional\)

I will recommend to use code editor when writing Python code. You can use [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

> A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose

### How to run Python with .py

Once you created a python file with code editor, save it with the format `.py` and you can run it with terminal \(MacOS, Linux\) or CMD \(Windows\). For detail you can refer to [Hello World - Run the code](https://i01er.gitbook.io/python-tutorial/hello-world#run-the-code).



#### Jupyter Notebook \(Optional\)

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook can use for writing and testing Python code on web or on-premise machine.

> Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.
