# Install Tools

Before we start coding Python, we need some tools/libraries:

#### Python 

The most important, Python itself ;\)

Visit [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page download the latest version of Python \(3.8.3\), if you need 2.X version, download 2.7. Usually we will recommend to download the latest version, but some application may require a specific version of Python.



#### Code Editor \(Optional\)

I will recommend to use code editor when writing Python code. You can use [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

> A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose
