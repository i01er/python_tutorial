description: Assigning our data to the variable

# Variable

We can assign different data to the variable, even the sam variable, called "dynamic typing".

```python
>>> a = 5
>>> print a
5

>>> a = "Hello"
>>> print a
Hello

>>> a = a + "World"
Hello World
```

As the result, we can know that Python can perform concatenation. When "a" is equal to "a" plus "World", Python will adding "Hello" and "World" together then assign the whole string into variable "a".
