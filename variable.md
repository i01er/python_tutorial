description: Assigning our data to the variable
---

# Variable

We can assign different data to the variable, even the sam variable, called "dynamic typing".

```python
>>> a = 5
>>> print a
5

>>> a = "Hello"
>>> print a
Hello

>>> a = a + "World"
Hello World
```

As the result, we can know that Python can perform concatenation. When "a" is equal to "a" plus "World", Python will adding "Hello" and "World" together then assign the whole string into variable "a".

Variable can store string, number, array, function...

```python
>>> apple = "Hello World"    //String
>>> print apple
Hello World

>>> apple = 15               //Number
>>> print apple
15

>>> apple = [1, 5, 7]        //Array, we will talk more next chapter
>>> print apple[0]
1

And More...We will be learning all of them later:)
